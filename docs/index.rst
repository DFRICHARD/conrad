Why conrad?
-----------

- ðŸ“… Never miss CFP deadlines again. ``conrad remind`` can remind you every time you open a terminal!
- ðŸ“Š Query and explore events using tags, names, locations, and dates. ``conrad show --cfp`` will tell you about events where the CFP is open!
- ðŸ¤– Crawlers update events twice a week! (Monday and Thursday at 00:00 UTC)

Installation
------------

You can simply use pip to install ``conrad``::

    $ pip install conference-radar

Features
--------

Continuous updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The event list is maintained in ``data/events.json``. This list is continuously updated by the available ``crawlers`` using GitHub Actions.

Sources:

- https://pydata.org/event-schedule
- https://github.com/ildoc/awesome-italy-events
- https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences
- https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar

Set reminders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set CFP reminders so that you never miss a deadline! The color changes based on event proximity::

    $ conrad remind -i 6bb714
    $ conrad remind

.. note:: Add ``conrad remind`` to your shell startup file so that you get a reminder every time you open a new terminal!

Query and explore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can query and explore the event database using various filters.

Look at events which have an open call for proposals (CFP)::

    $ conrad show --cfp

.. image:: _static/show-cfp.png

Look at conferences using a tag::

    $ conrad show --tag python

.. image:: _static/show-tag.png

Look at conferences using a name::

    $ conrad show --name pycon

.. image:: _static/show-name.png

Look at conferences in a city, state or country::

    $ conrad show --location usa

.. image:: _static/show-location.png

Look at conferences based on when they're happening::

    $ conrad show --date ">= 2019-10-01" --date "<= 2020-01-01"

.. image:: _static/show-date.png

Refresh event database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can get the latest events using::

    $ conrad refresh
